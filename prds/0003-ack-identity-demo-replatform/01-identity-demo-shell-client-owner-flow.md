# 01 - Identity demo shell with client owner flow

Status: needs-triage

## What to build

Create a dedicated `apps/identity-demo` Next app scaffold with app-router and app-scoped env loading, then deliver the first guided demo step end-to-end: initialize an in-memory demo session and create/render the client owner DID plus DID document in the browser.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `apps/identity-demo` runs with the same monorepo workflow as existing apps (`dev`, `build`, `start`)
- [ ] Env bootstrap follows the existing `@oss/env/*` pattern and loads without db/auth dependencies
- [ ] The guided UI includes a step that creates the client owner in-memory and renders DID artifacts
- [ ] One app-level integration test verifies this first step is executable in-browser
